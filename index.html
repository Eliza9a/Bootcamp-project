    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Game</h3>
    <p>My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City(2021).
       This Processing project comprises the use of conditionals, loops, arrays and randomness.
       I created a game where the player collects the snacks until the time is over. 
       For this game I used an image as a background, but I drew the eyes and made them move towards 
       the mouse position. The details( for example: colour, size, position, speed and shape) of the 
       snacks are stored in arrays and their values are random so the game has different levels of 
       difficulty. When the time is over, a message will appear on the screen saying the score.
